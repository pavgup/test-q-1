Here are some notes for the first test to decipher the code and use of the code:

1. The VAT configuration is located in the application.rb configuration file within the RoR config root.
2. Views are functional (with the exception of the note required for a cancelled order which requires a note variable to be passed to the app).
3. Despite the fat model paradigm, most of the logic associated with this app has made its way into controllers.
4. The routes used for all of the models (users, line_items, orders, and products) are generally just the normal CRUD resources routes with the following exceptions:
4a. /orders/:id/place is the URL to change an order's status to PLACED
4b. /orders/:id/cancel is the URL to change an order's status to CANCELLED (remember to pass a note variable to this -- e.g., /orders/1/cancel?note=Some%20Text)
4c. /orders/:id/pay is the URL to change an order's status to PAID
